# VS Code keybindings file for Mac

This is my personal Visual Studio Code setting for the keyboard when using a Mac.

Those shortcuts are similar to the ones that I were using when I was using `NetBeans`.

## Usage

1. Open `Preference` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts` and then click on the `keybinding.json` link just below the Search field.
2. The `keybinding.json` file is opening with the default view and the personalized one.
3. Replace the second one with the file in this repository.

## Some examples

| Command (Mac) | Command (Win) | Execution |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| `Command+E` | `CTRL+E` | Delete entire line |
| `Command+Shift+C` | `CTRL+Shift+C` | Toggle line comment for the selected lines |
| `Alt+Shift+Up` or `...+Down` | `Alt+Shift+Up` or `...+Down` | Move line up or down |
| `Command+Shift+Up` or `...+Down` | `CTRL+Shift+Up` or `...+Down` | Copy line up or down |
| `Command+E` | `CTRL+E` | Delete entire line |
| `Alt+Shift+F` | `Alt+Shift+F` | Format the selected block of lines |
| `Command+H` | `CTRL+H` | Find and replace in the active file |
